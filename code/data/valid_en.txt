The O

The O
plan O
has O
raised B-MED
a O

protest O
from O
U.S. B-LOC
avocado O
growers O
, O
who O
are O
largely O
concentrated O
in O
California B-LOC

California B-LOC
growers O
have O
charged I-MED
that O
removing O
the O

, O
even I-MED

basis O
, O
would O
endanger O

Mexican B-MED
officials O
contend O
that O
there O
is O
no O
scientific O
basis O
for O
the O

that O
it O

say O
the O

has O
enough O

" O
From O
a O
common-sense O

the O

one I-MED
